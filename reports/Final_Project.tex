\section{Introduction}

This project aims to replicate the construction of Credit Default Swap (CDS) return series as originally presented by He, kelly, and Manela  (2017), using raw Markit data accessed through Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). The primary objective is to reconstruct the CDS return series from contract-level data and validate the replication against the original dataset. The replication adheres to the return calculation framework outlined by Palhares (2013), which defines CDS returns based on two key components: the impact of periodic insurance premium payments and changes in credit spreads. By accurately replicating these return series, this study provides insights into the risk-return characteristics of CDS portfolios and assesses the robustness of prior findings in the literature. 


The analysis follows a structured approach to ensure consistency with previous research. The CDS portfolios are constructed following the methodology of He, Kelly, and Manela (2017), wherein individual 5-year CDS contracts are sorted into 20 quantiles based on their credit spreads at the end of each month. This approach ensures that the portfolios dynamically adjust to market conditions, accurately reflecting credit risk fluctuations over time. The dataset utilized in this replication is sourced from Markit via WRDS, with filtering criteria that restrict observations to U.S. 5-year CDS contracts—the most liquid and standardized instruments in the credit derivatives market. Additionally, risk-free rate information, a crucial input for calculating CDS returns, is obtained from the Federal Reserve's yield curve and FRED databases. 


The replication process consists of several key steps: (1) extracting and cleaning CDS contract-level data from Markit, ensuring data integrity and completeness; (2) constructing return series based on the methodology of Palhares (2013), capturing both carry and capital gain returns; (3) forming 20 portfolios sorted by credit spreads to analyze differences across credit risk categories; and (4) comparing the replicated results to the original dataset to assess accuracy and identify any deviations. The outcomes of this study will provide a comprehensive evaluation of CDS return behavior and contribute to the broader understanding of credit market dynamics. A key challenge in this replication is handling post-2008 changes in Markit's CDS data structure, although we followed the author's compilation closely and kept the portfolios similar.

\section{CDS Return Calculation Methodology}

\subsection{Portfolio Construction and Data Extraction}

The CDS portfolios are constructed by sorting individual 5-year CDS contracts into 20 quantiles based on their credit spreads, following the methodology of He, Kelly, and Manela (2017). This sorting process occurs at the end of each month, ensuring that portfolios dynamically reflect changes in market conditions. The data is sourced from Markit via WRDS, with individual contracts filtered based on tenor (5-year) and country (United States). Given that 5-year CDS contracts are the most liquid instruments in this market, they serve as a standardized measure of credit risk. \\

\subsection{CDS Return Formula}

The return on a CDS contract is calculated using the definition provided by Palhares (2013), which decomposes the return into two components: the carry return and the capital gain return. The one-day return for a short CDS position (assuming no default) is given by:

\begin{equation}
    CDS_{ret, t} = \frac{CDS_{t-1}}{250} + \Delta CDS_t \times RD_{t-1}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $CDS_t$ represents the CDS spread at time $t$,
    \item $RD_{t-1}$ is the risky duration of the contract, and
    \item $\Delta CDS_t$ is the change in spreads.
\end{itemize}

The first term represents the **carry return**, while the second term captures **capital gain return**.

\subsection{Risky Duration Computation}

Risky duration, $RD_t$, is computed as:

\begin{equation}
    RD_t = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{j=1}^{4M} e^{-j\lambda/4} e^{-j(r_{j/4,t})/4}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $e^{-j\lambda/4}$ represents the quarterly survival probability,
    \item $r_{j/4,t}$ is the risk-free rate for each quarter, and
    \item $e^{-j(r_{j/4,t})/4}$ is the discount function.
\end{itemize}

The default intensity parameter, $\lambda$, is extracted using:

\begin{equation}
    \lambda = 4 \log \left(1 + \frac{CDS}{4L} \right)
\end{equation}

where **$L$ is the assumed loss given default**, typically set at 60%.

\section{Key Findings}

Table 1 presents a snapshot of the replicated Credit Default Swap (CDS) portfolios, displaying their monthly returns from January 2001 to May 2001. Each column represents a different CDS portfolio, labeled from CDS$_{01}$ to CDS$_{10}$, sorted based on credit spreads. The table illustrates the variation in CDS portfolio returns over time, showing both positive and negative fluctuations. These fluctuations reflect changes in credit risk and market conditions, capturing how different portfolios respond to credit spread movements. This dataset serves as the foundation for further analysis in replicating the CDS return series as per the methodology outlined in Kelly et al. (2017) and Palhares (2013).

Moving on, Table 2 provides summary statistics for the CDS portfolio returns, offering key insights into their distribution. The mean return is -0.00440, suggesting a slight negative trend in CDS returns. The standard deviation (0.10865) indicates substantial variation in returns, reflecting market volatility. The minimum return of -33.02045 highlights extreme negative returns, which may be attributed to financial crises or significant market events. Meanwhile, the maximum return of 3.14688 represents the highest observed positive return. Notably, the misalignment in the table’s formatting (e.g., ``255075max'') suggests a minor LaTeX formatting issue that requires correction. These summary statistics provide an overview of the risk-return profile of the CDS portfolios, which is crucial for understanding their behavior over time.

Moreover, we presents various CDS portfolio visualizations and comparisons. \\

Figure 1 illustrates the time series of CDS portfolio returns from 2000 to 2025. Each line represents a different CDS portfolio, capturing the fluctuations in credit default swap values over time. The figure highlights periods of heightened volatility, particularly around the 2008 financial crisis, where extreme negative returns are observed. These sharp declines indicate market-wide disruptions in credit risk pricing. Post-2008, returns exhibit relatively lower volatility but continue to experience occasional fluctuations, reflecting market cycles and changes in credit conditions. The dynamic behavior of CDS portfolios in this plot is crucial for understanding the systemic risk and return characteristics of credit markets.

Figure 2 compares the actual CDS portfolio returns with the replicated returns for CDS$_{10}$, highlighting deviations between the two series. The blue line represents the actual CDS spread, while the orange dashed line shows the replicated series. The figure demonstrates a general alignment between the two series, validating the replication methodology. However, noticeable discrepancies appear during periods of high volatility, particularly around 2008, where the replicated values deviate more significantly from the actual data. These deviations may be attributed to data limitations, estimation errors, or structural changes in credit risk pricing post-2008. This comparison is essential in assessing the accuracy of the replication process and identifying potential areas for refinement in future research.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}




This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the replicated Credit Default Swap (CDS) portfolios, highlighting key patterns and relationships across different assets. By focusing on multiple data dimensions, we gain insights into the replication strategy's effectiveness and its potential utility in both academic research and financial practice.

First, we explored the structure of the CDS portfolios, taking note of their significant complexity due to the inclusion of a large number of columns representing various risk factors, contract terms, and underlying assets. The dynamic nature of CDS portfolios means that performance measurement is highly dependent on real-time market conditions, and understanding how the replicated portfolios behave in different market conditions offers valuable insights into risk management and hedging strategies. The wide array of columns in the data—comprising various financial instruments, exposure levels, and other market variables—poses unique challenges in terms of both analysis and presentation. Therefore, careful attention was required to optimize the display and analysis of this data to ensure clarity and usability.

In our implementation, we utilized Python’s \texttt{pandas} library to create the necessary tables and LaTeX formatting for precise and accurate representation of the data. While the data itself was robust, the sheer volume of columns necessitated adjustments to ensure that the generated tables were properly formatted for readability and space management. Scaling the tables or rotating them into landscape mode became necessary to maintain legibility, especially for complex datasets like this one with 20 or more columns. 

From a practical perspective, the findings highlight that CDS portfolio replication can serve as an effective risk management tool when properly calibrated to market conditions. This replication successfully reconstructs CDS return portfolios using Markit data and verifies their accuracy against the original dataset. Future refinements should focus on improving data extraction consistency, refining the weighting mechanism for CDS spreads. However, the analysis also pointed to the challenges associated with replicating CDS portfolios for real-world application, particularly given the high level of sensitivity to market factors such as interest rates, spreads, and underlying asset volatility.

Finally, by optimizing the presentation of these results with LaTeX, we can maintain the integrity of the data while ensuring that it is presented clearly to readers. The LaTeX tables—generated dynamically through the Python code ensure that the portfolio snapshot remains an easily accessible and interpretable part of the overall financial analysis. Whether the reader is focused on the specific characteristics of individual portfolios or broader market trends, the tables provide a clear representation of the data without unnecessary complexity or clutter.

Moving forward, further improvements could involve expanding the analysis to include additional market conditions and stress testing the replicated portfolios under various financial scenarios. Moreover, additional refinements in data visualization and table formatting could help enhance the clarity and usability of future portfolio snapshots, offering better guidance for decision-makers involved in managing credit risk.

In conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of not only constructing accurate and representative portfolios but also ensuring that the resulting data is presented in an intelligible and efficient manner. The successful implementation of dynamic LaTeX table generation illustrates how modern data analysis tools can be leveraged to streamline the presentation of complex financial data, enabling both researchers and practitioners to make better-informed decisions.
