# Manually-Created Data

This folder is used to hold manually created data that cannot be easily replicated.
You may keep data here and keep it under version control if it is small enough.
Keeping this data under version control can provide some peace of mind
that the data is not inadvertently modified.
Also, keep in mind that Git LFS is a good option if the data is large.
